# CAPH3 Usage Examples

## dropdown-list selected event
 1. Select one Item of the list, how could i make to disappear the list?

 2. In Item lists, i'd like to change ui style when each item gets focus. Is there event handler like on-focused and on-blurred of caph-button in caph-dropdown-list?

key point:

-   init selected func in dropdown-list: on-select-item="selectItem($itemId, $event)"
-   implement your selected callback function.
